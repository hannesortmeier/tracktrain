# TrackTrain - quetify

Simple frontend done with vuejs for adding spotify tracks to the spotify player queue. Perfect for parties since there is no pause or skip button. The only functionality is to search for tracks and to add them to the current queue.

Since there is no way to get the current queue from the spotify api, the app can only show tracks in the queue that were inserted through the app.

There is still a lot to do!

It looks like you are not able to add tracks to the spotify queue through the spotify api if the device you are listening from is a wlan speaker. This is why the project is currently on ice. Spotify needs to fix their api first.
